# mergesort
In my experience writing this merge sort it is a lot harder to actually write than a bubble sort. I kept getting out of bounds errors or just something
would mess up. It was really tough for me to actually get to work. In the end though I can tell a merge sort works a lot better and more efficiently than
a bubble sort. a bubble sort only really goes through something one at a time. while a mergesort splits it into easier bites to handle and compare.
If i was tasked to sort 2000 numbers I would use a merge sort everytime.
